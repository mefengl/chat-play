# ChatGPT Infinite

ChatGPT-Infinite is a UserScript that automates the process of generating questions in the OpenAI chat interface. This script asks ChatGPT to generate a question, and then asks the generated question back to ChatGPT.

## Stop

To stop the script, disable it from the UserScript manager and refresh the chat interface page.

## Usage
Open the OpenAI chat interface in your browser.
The script will automatically start running when you open the chat interface.

Wait for the script to generate a question and ask it to ChatGPT.

ChatGPT will respond with an answer to the question and generate a new question.

The script will ask the new question to ChatGPT, and the process repeats indefinitely.

Note: If the script does not start running automatically, refresh the chat interface page.
